# Tic-Tac-Toe
i learnt to build this version of tic-tac-toe from an indian utuber i originally started to build this from free code camp's 12 easy projects for beginners but their concepts
seemed kinda complex for me at the time and since i found a rather less complicated approach to the project i went and created it from there
